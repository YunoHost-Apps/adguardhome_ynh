## Overview

AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side software for that.

It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a "black hole", thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It's based on software we use for our public AdGuard DNS servers -- both share a lot of common code.

**Important note**: This AdGuard Home package needs to disable Dnsmasq on the main network interface to allow AdGuard Home to listen DNS resquest using it.  
However, Dnsmasq is not disabled and will continue to function as the *localhost DNS server*.


**Shipped version:** 0.107.51~ynh1

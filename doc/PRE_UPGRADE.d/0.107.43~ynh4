From this 0.107.43~ynh4 version, some things have changed:  
- port 53 is no longer exposed on the Internet by default, it's now a deliberate choice  
- it is now possible to use DoH and DoQ with Let's Encrypt certificates out of the box, but this is also disabled by default for the same reason.

To activate either of these features, please use the config panel:  
Applications → AdGuard Home → AdGuard Home configuration  
- Expose port 53 to the Internet?  
- Enable DNS-over-HTTPS/QUIC?

This update is at risk of crashing AdGuard Home, so:  
If any trouble or question, please refer to [the package's admin docs](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/adguardhome_ynh/blob/master/doc/ADMIN.md)! ^w^  
If needed and a similar issue does not already exist, please [open an issue on the GitHub's package page](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/adguardhome_ynh/issues)!
